A Grunt job to minify all css files in `./src` and publish them in `build/style.css`.

**Install node and npm**

Suggested: [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). Once installed, install node:

```bash
nvm install node
```

**Install Grunt**

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Run `npm install` in source.

Run `grunt` and `build/style.css` will be created.

Happy hacking 🐷
